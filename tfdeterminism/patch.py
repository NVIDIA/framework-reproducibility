  Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which the
  classes are mutually exclusive (each entry is in exactly one class).  For
  example, each CIFAR-10 image is labeled with one and only one label: an image
  can be a dog or a truck, but not both.
  **NOTE:**  While the classes are mutually exclusive, their probabilities
  need not be.  All that is required is that each row of `labels` is
  a valid probability distribution.  If they are not, the computation of the
  gradient will be incorrect.
  If using exclusive `labels` (wherein one and only
  one class is true at a time), see `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.
  **WARNING:** This op expects unscaled logits, since it performs a `softmax`
  on `logits` internally for efficiency.  Do not call this op with the
  output of `softmax`, as it will produce incorrect results.
  A common use case is to have logits and labels of shape
  `[batch_size, num_classes]`, but higher dimensions are supported, with
  the `dim` argument specifying the class dimension.
  Backpropagation will happen only into `logits`.  To calculate a cross entropy
  loss that allows backpropagation into both `logits` and `labels`, see
  `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.
  **Note that to avoid confusion, it is required to pass only named arguments to
  this function.**
  Args:
    _sentinel: Used to prevent positional parameters. Internal, do not use.
    labels: Each vector along the class dimension should hold a valid
      probability distribution e.g. for the case in which labels are of shape
      `[batch_size, num_classes]`, each row of `labels[i]` must be a valid
      probability distribution.
    logits: Per-label activations, typically a linear output. These activation
      energies are interpreted as unnormalized log probabilities.
    dim: The class dimension. Defaulted to -1 which is the last dimension.
    name: A name for the operation (optional).
    axis: Alias for dim.
  Returns:
    A `Tensor` that contains the softmax cross entropy loss. Its type is the
    same as `logits` and its shape is the same as `labels` except that it does
    not have the last dimension of `labels`.
