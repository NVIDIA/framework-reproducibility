# Final Releases of Deprecated PyPI Package Names

In this current directory, use the `setup.py` script to complete the release
(e.g. `python3 setup.py {sdist, bdist_wheel}`, etc), as documented in the
standard [release procedures](../release_procedure.md), after having set
`package_name` appropriately in the script (using commenting-in/out).
